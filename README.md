DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a clustering algorithm widely used in machine learning and data analysis. It groups together data points that are closely packed, marking points in low-density regions as outliers.

Key Features of DBSCAN:
Density-Based Clustering:

Clusters are formed based on the density of data points in a region.
Points in high-density regions are part of the same cluster.
Noise Handling:

Points that do not fit into any cluster are labeled as noise or outliers.
Parameter Requirements:

eps (Îµ): The radius within which points are considered neighbors.
min_samples: The minimum number of points required to form a dense region.
Advantages:

Works well for arbitrary-shaped clusters.
Does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand.
Robust to outliers.
Disadvantages:

Sensitive to the choice of eps and min_samples.
Struggles with datasets with varying densities.
Algorithm Overview:
Classify points into three categories:
Core Points: Points with at least min_samples neighbors within eps.
Border Points: Points within eps of a core point but not themselves core points.
Noise Points: Points that are neither core nor border points.
Expand clusters starting from each core point.
Stop expanding when no more points meet the density criteria.
